**GPU** mode requires CUDA support via torch and transformers.  A 6.9B (or 12GB) model in 8-bit uses 7GB (or 13GB) of GPU memory. 8-bit or 4-bit precision can further reduce memory requirements.

**CPU** mode uses GPT4ALL and LLaMa.cpp, e.g. gpt4all-j, requiring about 14GB of system RAM in typical use.

GPU and CPU mode tested on variety of NVIDIA GPUs in Ubuntu 18-22, but any modern Linux variant should work.  MACOS support tested on Macbook Pro running Monterey v12.3.1 using CPU mode.

### Getting Started

First one needs a Python 3.10 environment.  For help installing a Python 3.10 environment, see [Install Python 3.10 Environment](docs/INSTALL.md#install-python-environment)

#### GPU (CUDA)

For help installing cuda toolkit, see [CUDA Toolkit](docs/INSTALL.md#installing-cuda-toolkit)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt.git
cd h2ogpt/src/h2ogpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oig-oasst1-512-6_9b --load_8bit=True
```
Then point browser at http://0.0.0.0:7860 (linux) or http://localhost:7860 (windows/mac) or the public live URL printed by the server (disable shared link with `--share=False`).  For 4-bit or 8-bit support, older GPUs may require older bitsandbytes installed as `pip uninstall bitsandbytes -y ; pip install bitsandbytes==0.38.1`.  For production uses, we recommend at least the 12B model, ran as:
```
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oasst1-512-12b --load_8bit=True
```
and one can use `--h2ocolors=False` to get soft blue-gray colors instead of H2O.ai colors.

Note if you download the model yourself and point `--base_model` to that location, you'll need to specify the prompt_type as well by running:
```
python generate.py --base_model=<user path> --load_8bit=True --prompt_type=human_bot
```
for some user path `<user path>`.

For quickly using a private document collection for Q/A, place documents (PDFs, text, etc.) into a folder called `user_path` and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements_optional_langchain.txt
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oig-oasst1-512-6_9b  --load_8bit=True --langchain_mode=UserData --user_path=user_path
```
For more ways to ingest on CLI and control see [LangChain Readme](docs/README_LangChain.md).

For 4-bit support, the latest dev versions of transformers, accelerate, and peft are required, which can be installed by running:
```bash
pip uninstall peft transformers accelerate -y
pip install -r requirements_optional_4bit.txt
```
where uninstall is required in case, e.g., peft was installed from GitHub previously.  Then when running generate pass `--load_4bit=True`, which is only supported for certain [architectures](https://github.com/huggingface/peft#models-support-matrix) like GPT-NeoX-20B, GPT-J, LLaMa, etc.

Any other instruct-tuned base models can be used, including non-h2oGPT ones.  [Larger models require more GPU memory](docs/FAQ.md#larger-models-require-more-gpu-memory).

#### CPU

CPU support is obtained after installing two optional requirements.txt files.  GPU support is also present if one has GPUs.

1. Install base, langchain, and GPT4All, and python LLaMa dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt.git
cd h2ogpt/src/h2ogpt
pip install -r requirements.txt -c req_constraints.txt
pip install -r requirements_optional_langchain.txt -c req_constraints.txt
pip install -r requirements_optional_gpt4all.txt -c req_constraints.txt
```
See [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) for details on installation instructions if any issues encountered.
One can run `make req_constraints.txt` to ensure that the constraints file is consistent with `requirements.txt`.

2. Change `.env_gpt4all` model name if desired.
```.env_gpt4all
model_path_llama=WizardLM-7B-uncensored.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin
model_path_gptj=ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin
model_name_gpt4all_llama=ggml-wizardLM-7B.q4_2.bin
```
For `gptj` and `gpt4all_llama`, you can choose a different model than our default choice by going to GPT4All Model explorer [GPT4All-J compatible model](https://gpt4all.io/index.html). One does not need to download manually, the gp4all package will download at runtime and put it into `.cache` like huggingface would.  However, `gpjt` model often gives [no output](docs/FAQ.md#gpt4all-not-producing-output), even outside h2oGPT.

So, for chatting, a better instruct fine-tuned LLaMa-based model for llama.cpp can be downloaded from [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).  For example, [13B WizardLM Quantized](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizardLM-13B-1.0-GGML) or [7B WizardLM Quantized](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GGML).  TheBloke has a variety of model types, quantization bit, and memory consumption.  Choose what is best for your system's specs.  However, be aware that LLaMa-based models are not [commercially viable](docs/FAQ.md#commercial-viability).

For 7B case, download [WizardLM-7B-uncensored.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GGML/blob/main/WizardLM-7B-uncensored.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin) into local path.  Then one sets `model_path_llama` in `.env_gpt4all`, which is currently the default.

3. Run generate.py

For LangChain support using documents in `user_path` folder, run h2oGPT like:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model='llama' --prompt_type=wizard2 --score_model=None --langchain_mode='UserData' --user_path=user_path
```
See [LangChain Readme](docs/README_LangChain.md) for more details.
For no langchain support (still uses LangChain package as model wrapper), run as:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model='llama' --prompt_type=wizard2 --score_model=None
```

No streaming is currently supported for these CPU models in UI, but that will be fixed soon.

#### MACOS

All instructions are same as for GPU or CPU installation, except first install [Rust](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-rust-in-macos/):
```bash
curl ‚Äìproto ‚Äò=https‚Äô ‚Äìtlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Enter new shell and test: `rustc --version`

When running a Mac with Intel hardware (not M1), you may run into `_clang: error: the clang compiler does not support '-march=native'_` during pip install.
If so, set your archflags during pip install. eg: `ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you encounter an error while building a wheel during the `pip install` process, you may need to install a C++ compiler on your computer.

#### Windows 10/11

All instructions are same as for GPU or CPU installation, except also need C++ compiler by doing:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022.
2. Make sure the following components are selected:
   * Universal Windows Platform development
   * C++ CMake tools for Windows
3. Download the MinGW installer from the [MinGW website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), i.e. `mingw32-gcc-g++`.
4. Run the installer and select the `gcc` component.

For GPU support of 4-bit and 8-bit, run:
```bash
pip install https://github.com/jllllll/bitsandbytes-windows-webui/blob/main/bitsandbytes-0.39.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
If you encounter issues on older GPUs, it may require older bitsandbytes installed as:
```
pip install https://github.com/jllllll/bitsandbytes-windows-webui/raw/main/bitsandbytes-0.38.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

#### CLI chat

The CLI can be used instead of gradio by running for some base model, e.g.:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --cli=True
```
and for LangChain run:
```bash
python make_db.py --user_path=user_path --collection_name=UserData
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --cli=True --langchain_mode=UserData
```
with documents in `user_path` folder, or directly run:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --cli=True --langchain_mode=UserData --user_path=user_path
```
which will build the database first time.  One can also use any other models, like:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oig-oasst1-512-6_9b --cli=True
```
or
```bash
python generate.py --base_model='llama' --prompt_type=wizard2 --cli=True
```
No streaming is currently supported for llama in CLI chat, but that will be fixed soon.

#### Gradio UI

`generate.py` by default runs a gradio server with a [UI (click for help with UI)](docs/FAQ.md#explain-things-in-ui).  Key benefits of the UI include:
* Save, export, import chat histories and undo or regenerate last query-response pair
* Upload and control documents of various kinds for document Q/A
* Choose which specific collection to query, or just chat with LLM
* Choose specific documents out of collection for asking questions
* Side-by-side 2-model comparison view
* RLHF response score evaluation for every query-response

See how we compare to other tools like PrivateGPT, see our comparisons at [h2oGPT's LangChain Integration FAQ](docs/README_LangChain.md#what-is-h2ogpts-langchain-integration-like).

We disable background uploads by disabling telemetry for huggingface, gradio, and chroma, and one can additionally avoid downloads (of fonts) by running `generate.py` with `--gradio_offline_level=2`.  See [Offline Documentation](docs/FAQ.md#offline-mode) for details.

#### Client API

`generate.py` by default runs a gradio server, which also gives access to client API using gradio client.  See example [test code](src/h2ogpt/client_test.py) or other tests in our [tests](https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt/blob/main/tests/test_client_calls.py).  Any element in [gradio_runner.py](src/h2ogpt/gradio_runner.py) with `api_name` defined can be accessed via the gradio client.
