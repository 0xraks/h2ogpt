## h2oGPT

h2oGPT is a large language model (LLM) fine-tuning framework and chatbot UI with document(s) question-answer capabilities.  Documents help to **ground** LLMs against hallucinations by providing them context relevant to the instruction.  h2oGPT is fully permissive Apache V2 open-source project for 100% private and secure use of LLMs and document embeddings for document question-answer.

Welcome!  Join us and make an issue or a PR, and contribute to making the best fine-tuned LLMs, chatbot UI, and document question-answer framework!

GPU mode requires CUDA support via torch and transformers.  A 6.9B (or 12GB) model in 8-bit uses 7GB (or 13GB) of GPU memory. 4-bit precision can further reduce memory requirements.

[CPU](FAQ.md#CPU) mode uses GPT4ALL and LLaMa.cpp, e.g. gpt4all-j, requiring about 14GB of system RAM in typical use.

GPU and CPU mode tested on variety of NVIDIA GPUs in Ubuntu 18-22, but any modern Linux variant should work.  MACOS support tested on Macbook Pro running Monterey v12.3.1 using CPU mode.

### General Roadmap items

- Integration of code and resulting LLMs with downstream applications and low/no-code platforms
- Complement h2oGPT chatbot with search and other APIs
- High-performance distributed training of larger models on trillion tokens
- Enhance the model's code completion, reasoning, and mathematical capabilities, ensure factual correctness, minimize hallucinations, and avoid repetitive output

### ChatBot and LangChain Roadmap items

- Add other tools like search
- Add agents for SQL and CSV question/answer

### Getting Started

For help installing a Python 3.10 environment, see [Install Python 3.10 Environment](INSTALL.md#install-python-environment)

#### GPU (CUDA)

For help installing cuda toolkit, see [CUDA Toolkit](INSTALL.md#install-cuda-121-install-cuda-coolkit)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt.git
cd h2ogpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oig-oasst1-512-6_9b --load_8bit=True
```
Then point browser at http://0.0.0.0:7860 (linux) or http://localhost:7860 (windows/mac) or the public live URL printed by the server (disable shared link with `--share=False`).

For quickly using a private document collection for Q/A, place documents (PDFs, text, etc.) into a folder called `user_path` and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements_optional_langchain.txt
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oig-oasst1-512-6_9b  --load_8bit=True --langchain_mode=UserData --user_path=user_path
```
For more ways to ingest on CLI and control see [LangChain Readme](README_LangChain.md).

Any other instruct-tuned base models can be used, including non-h2oGPT ones.  [Larger models require more GPU memory](FAQ.md#larger-models-require-more-gpu-memory).

#### CPU

CPU support is obtained after installing two optional requirements.txt files.  GPU support is also present if one has GPUs.

1) Install base, langchain, and GPT4All dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt.git
cd h2ogpt
pip install -r requirements.txt -c req_constraints.txt
pip install -r requirements_optional_langchain.txt -c req_constraints.txt
pip install -r requirements_optional_gpt4all.txt -c req_constraints.txt
```
See [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) for details on installation instructions if any issues encountered.
One can run `make req_constraints.txt` to ensure that the constraints file is consistent with `requirements.txt`.

2. Change `.env_gpt4all` model name if desired.
```.env_gpt4all
# model path and model_kwargs
model_path_gptj=ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin
```
You can choose a different model than our default choice by going to GPT4All Model explorer [GPT4All-J compatible model](https://gpt4all.io/index.html). Do not need to download, the gp4all package will download at runtime and put it into `.cache` like huggingface would.
See [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for instructions on getting model for `--base_model=llama` case.

3. Run generate.py

For LangChain support using documents in `user_path` folder, run h2oGPT like:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --score_model=None --langchain_mode='UserData' --user_path=user_path
```
See [LangChain Readme](README_LangChain.md) for more details.
For no langchain support (still uses LangChain package as model wrapper), run as:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --score_model=None
```

### CLI chat

The CLI can be used instead of gradio by running for some base model, e.g.:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --cli=True
```
and for LangChain run:
```bash
python make_db.py --user_path=user_path --collection_name=UserData
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --cli=True --langchain_mode=UserData
```
with documents in `user_path` folder, or directly run:
or
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=gptj --cli=True --langchain_mode=UserData --user_path=user_path
```
which will build the database first time.
One can also use any other models, like:
```bash
python generate.py --base_model=h2oai/h2ogpt-oig-oasst1-512-6_9b --cli=True
```

### Development
