### What are the different prompt types? How does prompt engineering work for h2oGPT?

In general, all LLMs use strings as inputs for training/fine-tuning and generation/inference.
To manage a variety of possible language task types, we divide any such string into three parts:

- Instruction
- Input
- Response

Each of these three parts can be empty or non-empty strings, such as titles or newlines. In the end, all
these prompt parts are concatenated into one string. The magic is in the content of those sub-strings. This is called **prompt engineering**.

#### Summarization

For training a summarization task, we concatenate these three parts together:

- Instruction = `<INSTRUCTION>`
- Input = `'## Main Text\n\n'` + `<INPUT>`
- Response = `'\n\n## Summary\n\n'` + `<OUTPUT>`

For each training record, we take `<INPUT>` and `<OUTPUT>` from the summarization dataset (typically two fields/columns), place them into the appropriate position, and turn that record into
one long string that the model can be trained with: `'## Main Text\n\nLarge Language Models are Useful.\n\n## Summary\n\nLLMs rock.'`

At inference time, we will take the `<INPUT>` only and stop right after `'\n\n## Summary\n\n'` and the model will generate the summary
as the continuation of the prompt.


#### ChatBot

For a conversational chatbot use case, we use the following 3 parts:

- Instruction = `<INSTRUCTION>`
- Input = `'<human>: '` + `<INPUT>`
- Response = `'<bot>: '` + `<OUTPUT>`

And a training string could look like this: `'<human>: hi, how are you?<bot>: Hi, I am doing great. How can I help you?'`.
At inference time, the model input would be like this: `'<human>: Tell me a joke about snow flakes.<bot>: '`, and the model would generate the bot part.


### How to prepare data?

Training data (in `JSON` format) must contain at least one column that maps to `instruction`, `input` or `output`.
Their content will be placed into the `<INSTRUCTION>`, `<INPUT>` and `<OUTPUT>` placeholders mentioned above.
The chosen `prompt_type` will fill in the strings in between to form the actual input into the model.
Any missing columns will lead to empty strings. Optional `--data_col_dict={'A': 'input', 'B': 'output'}` argument can
be used to map different column names into the required ones.

#### Examples

Below are examples of training records in `JSON` format.

- `human_bot` prompt type
```json
{
  "input": "Who are you?",
  "output": "My name is h2oGPT.",
  "prompt_type": "human_bot"
}
```

- `plain` version of `human_bot`, useful for longer conversations
```json
{
  "input": "<human>: Who are you?\n<bot>: My name is h2oGPT.\n<human>: Can you write a poem about horses?\n<bot>: Yes, of course. Here it goes...",
  "prompt_type": "plain"
}
```

- `summarize` prompt type
```json
{
  "instruction": "",
  "input": "Long long long text.",
  "output": "text.",
  "prompt_type": "summarize"
}
```

### Context length

Note that the total length of the text (i.e., input and output) the LLM can handle is limited by the so-called *context length*. For our current models, the context length is 2048 tokens. Longer context lengths are computationally more expensive due to the interactions between all tokens in the sequence.
A context length of 2048 means that for an input of, for example, 1900 tokens, the model will be able to create no more than 148 new tokens as part of the output.

For fine-tuning, if the average length of inputs is less than the context length, one can provide a `cutoff_len` of less than the context length to truncate inputs to this amount of tokens. For most instruction-type datasets, a cutoff length of 512 seems reasonable and provides nice memory and time savings.
For example, the `h2oai/h2ogpt-oasst1-512-20b` model was trained with a cutoff length of 512.

### Tokens

Here are some example tokens (from a total of ~50k), each of which is assigned a number:
```text
"osed": 1700,
"ised": 1701,
"================": 1702,
"ED": 1703,
"sec": 1704,
"Ġcome": 1705,
"34": 1706,
"ĠThere": 1707,
"Ġlight": 1708,
"Ġassoci": 1709,
"gram": 1710,
"Ġold": 1711,
"Ġ{#": 1712,
```
The model is trained with these specific numbers, so the tokenizer must be kept the same for training and inference/generation.
The input format doesn't change whether the model is in pretraining, fine-tuning or inference mode, but the text itself can change slightly for better results, and that's called prompt engineering.

### Why does h2oGPT say it was trained by OpenAI or Open Assistant?

As explained on the [model card](https://huggingface.co/h2oai/h2ogpt-oasst1-512-20b) h2oGPT is a fine-tuned version
of [GPT-NeoX-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b), which was trained on the [Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/)
and on the [h2oai/openassistant_oasst1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/h2oai/openassistant_oasst1).
These datasets contain training data created by OpenAI (from the GPT-2 days) and by Open Assistant, which injected the above
answer and similar answers. In other words, they "contaminated" the training data with their desired outputs for the model (i.e., personality).
Most of the knowledge of the model is from pre-training on the billions of tokens, the fine-tuning only turns that language
model into a chatbot by returning short answers for short questions, or in other words, pre-training creates language
understanding and some knowledge, while fine-tuning injects style. Certain simple personality traits can be modified by fine-tuning however, and we are working on giving h2oGPT proper personality: https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt/issues/73

#### Update
We continued fine-tuning with the [h2oai/h2oai/openassistant_oasst1_h2ogpt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/h2oai/openassistant_oasst1_h2ogpt) dataset, which includes some personalization, and the effects are noticeable.

### Is h2oGPT multi-lingual?

Yes. Try it in your preferred language.


### Throttle GPUs in case of reset/reboot

Power limit for GPU 00000000:5E:00.0 was set to 250.00 W from 300.00 W.
Power limit for GPU 00000000:86:00.0 was set to 250.00 W from 300.00 W.
Power limit for GPU 00000000:AF:00.0 was set to 250.00 W from 300.00 W.
All done.
```

### Use Wiki Data

```python

>>> wk = load_dataset("wikipedia", "20220301.en")
>>> wk
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['id', 'url', 'title', 'text'],
        num_rows: 6458670
    })
})
>>> sentences = ".".join(wk['train'][0]['text'].split('.')[0:2])
